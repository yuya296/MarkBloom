MarkBloom is a VS Code extension for **reviewing and editing Markdown** in a way that is friendly for humans, while keeping **Markdown as the single source of truth**.

## Purpose

- Make Markdown documents easier to **read, review, and iterate** on
- Reduce friction when editing “structure-heavy” Markdown (especially tables)
- Keep changes **diff-friendly** and compatible with normal Git workflows

## Philosophy

- **Human is primary**: AI can draft, but people should be able to review and correct quickly
- **Markdown is truth**: no separate data model that diverges from the `.md` file
- **Edit without fear**: improve readability and editability without breaking the source

## Non-goals

- Replacing Markdown with a proprietary document format
- Building a full Notion-like workspace or database
